# MySQL Home Loan Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a Home Loan Management System using MySQL.  
It demonstrates database design, SQL queries, and business reporting.

## 🗂 Files
- `schema.sql` → Creates tables and inserts sample data
- `queries.sql` → Contains analysis queries
- `README.md` → Documentation and insights

## 📊 Analysis Queries Explained
1. Loan disbursement by city → Identifies regions with highest demand
2. Average interest rate by tenure → Shows pricing trends
3. Top 5 customers by loan amount → Highlights key customers
4. Repayment progress → Tracks loan repayment percentage
5. Monthly payment trends → Useful for cash flow forecasting
6. High-value loans → Risk assessment for loans above ₹5 lakh
7. Loan-to-income ratio → Evaluates affordability and default risk
8. Customer Loan portfolio
9. Highest Paying Customers (Total Payments Made)
10. Loans Near Completion (≥80% Paid)
11. City-wise Average Income vs Loan Amount
12. Interest Revenue Projection (Expected Total Interest)
13. Delayed Payments (Payments after due date assumption)
14. Customer Loan Tenure Distribution
15. Default Risk Flag (Customers with High Loan-to-Income Ratio and Low Payments)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Run `schema.sql` to create tables and insert data
2. Run queries from `queries.sql` to generate insights
3. Use results for reporting and analysis
